            <h4>Use Video</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that your webcam is connected to your computer.  If it is not, connect it to your computer and refresh your browser's screen (you may have to login again).</li>
                <li>Make sure that there is no other application currently using your camera.  If so, quit all other applications that are using your camera and try again.</li>
                <li>If you do not see your video window or it displays "Image Not Available", you may have to manually select your webcam.  To do so, right-click (or CTRL-click on a one-button Mac mouse) on the empty window and select "Settings".  Navigate to the tab with the webcam icon.  Ensure that your webcam is selected in the drop-down menu.</li>
