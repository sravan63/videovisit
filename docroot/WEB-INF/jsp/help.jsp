            <h4>Use Video</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that your webcam is connected to your computer.  If it is not, connect it to your computer and refresh your browser's screen (you may have to login again).</li>
                <li>Make sure that there is no other application currently using your camera.  If so, quit all other applications that are using your camera and try again.</li>
                <li>If you do not see your video window or it displays "Image Not Available", you may have to manually select your webcam.  To do so, right-click (or CTRL-click on a one-button Mac mouse) on the empty window and select "Settings".  Navigate to the tab with the webcam icon.  Ensure that your webcam is selected in the drop-down menu.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="helpAudio" class="helptabs">
            <h4>Use Audio</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>By default, the Video Visits website will try to use your computer's speakers and microphone for audio.  Make sure your microphone and speakers are turned on and not muted.  If you don't want to use audio through the website, you can turn off this feature by clicking the big microphone button on the right side of the video visit page.</li>
                <li>You can adjust the sensitivity of your microphone with the slider located to the left of the microphone button.</li>
                <li> If you're experiencing an echo when using audio through the Internet, right-click on your video window, and select "Settings". Click on the microphone tab, and check the box "Reduce Echo" (Note: Depending on your version of Adobe Flash you may not see this option).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="helpOther" class="helptabs">
            <h4>Other Help</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You can send instant messages to your clinician. Click the chat window at the bottom of the "Public Chat" module in the lower right portion of the screen.  Simply type your message and hit "Enter" on your keyboard and the message will instantly display to the other party.</li>
