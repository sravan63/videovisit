                                <p class="login">We are excited to offer you Video Visits in our ongoing efforts to increase your convenience while still offering high quality health care.  This feature allows you to securely connect with your Kaiser Permanente clinician from the convenience of your home.  All you need is a computer, webcam, and a broadband internet connection.</p>
                                <p class="login">Our clinicians carefully consider which types of appointments are appropriate for video, and only offer video visits when they can provide value and convenience to the patient.  If, for whatever reason, you are not comfortable using video please contact your local Kaiser Permanente facility, and we would be happy to schedule an in-person appointment.</p>
                                <p class="login">If this is your first video visit, please take a moment to check your video setup using our <a href="setup.htm">Setup Wizard</a> </p>
